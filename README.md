# Handwritten Recognition using Python and Tensorflow
### Here we are building an app that will upon drawing what it is requesting accept it as true after it recognizes it. 
## Section 1 (architecture)
### When building this app we make the template which will be the files that will house our handwriting recognition app front-end. 
### the static files are the css and jquery. 
### the app.py is the flask app file that houses the routes and encoder.
## Section 2 (backend and data)
### once you install numpy and import it in your app.py add into the post of /add-data labels = np.array()
## Section 3 (how to use)
### if you have python 3 installed matplotlib, flask, and numpy installed using pip simply open the script data_distribution to see how the data is being distributed by simply in terminal typing `python scripts/data_distribution.py`
